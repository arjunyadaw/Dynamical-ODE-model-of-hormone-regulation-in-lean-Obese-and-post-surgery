# A tissue- and organ-based cell biological atlas of obesity-related human genes and cellular pathways
In this repository, we are providing codes of dynamical model of above mentioned paper. Our model describes the kinetics of eleven different hormones secreted by the different organs in the digestive system in response to meal.. Glucose ingestion, absorption, production, utilization and degradation and each hormone's secretion, first pass through the liver, utilization and degradation were considered. The model comprises seven explicit compartments (stomach, intestine, pancreas, adipocytes, plasma, muscle and liver) and one black-box compartment (degradation). A scheme of the interactions in the model is shown in Figure3A. Given the complexity of the system, and the availability of only plasma glucose and hormone concentrations to find the parameters, the  parameter estimation methodologies were used to build a reliable model [61-64]. The model parameters were numerically identified by nonlinear least-squares as implemented in MATLAB 2020a.
